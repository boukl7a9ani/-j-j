# Chess Game Project

This is a simple chess game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game supports two-player mode and basic chess piece movements. Future enhancements include AI for single-player mode, advanced move validation, and more.

## Features
- Classic 8x8 chessboard with all standard pieces
- Turn-based play between two players

## Project Structure
- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the chessboard.
- **`assets/css/styles.css`**: The CSS file for styling the chessboard and pieces.
- **`assets/chess-pieces/`**: A folder containing images of chess pieces in both black and white.
- **`js/mains.js`**: The main JavaScript file handling game logic, including piece movement, turn switching, and win conditions.

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
